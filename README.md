## Introduction

This is a study project done in the course "Data Science Em Produ√ß√£o", of the Data Scientist Meigarom Lopes. The purpose of the project was to cover all the steps of a data science project, from the business knowledge to deploy, using techniques of data engineering, exploratory data analysis and machine learning.

The main idea was not only use the data and apply advanced techiniques to it, but also to understand the business context, so then find the best implementation solution in the business problem, always looking for results that really impact positively in the context.

This document will serve as a study review guide. The description of the steps used in the project are included in the next session. 

The story is fictional and was created only to contextualize the analysis.

## 1.0. The Business Problem

The Rossmann business team identified a demand for reforms at regional branches. To anticipate this gut, the company's CFO contacted each branch manager asking for a forecast of daily sales for the next six weeks.

The managers of each branch contacted the Data Science team to make this forecast. When investigating the business problem in depth, some essential points for the production of any solution were identified:

* **Motivation**: A demand from the CFO to know the sales forecast for the next six weeks;

* **Root Cause**: The CFO need the sales forecast for the next six week to antecipate fund to invest in the store reforms;

* **Stakeholder**: The CFO;

## 2.0 Solution strategy

The solution format will be a sales forecast for each store for the next six weeks, and Machine Learning techniques focused on Regression should be used to make this demand forecast possible. A daily granularity per store will also be assumed for the forecast, that is, our input data will be the daily sales of the stores.

The final format will be a Telgram Bot, which the CFO will be able to access in real time the demand forecast to the next six weeks of any store anywhere, depending only on an internet connection and an account in the Telegram application.

* **Granularity**: For day for store;
    
* **Type of problem**: A Demand forecast;
     
* **Solution**: Regression;
     
* **Delivery method:** Telegram Bot.

## 3.0 Insights


### Stores with closer competitors should sell less - FALSE

Common sense would lead us to imagine that the distance between competitors could have a certain impact on store sales, where stores that are competing for the same audience would divide the customers from that location. The real impact of this variable can be seen in the following graphs:

!['H2'](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73614098/110251310-4c5cd780-7f56-11eb-9330-e0e1f831b4a9.png)

The first graph allows us to have a macro view of the problem. It is possible to understand how the number of sales of each store is concentrated in relation to the other stores, and it is possible to perceive that, despite some outliers present, the vast majority of stores, regardless of the distance between them, concentrate the same number of sales.

The second graph is an analysis with limited intervals, showing only the distances that occur frequently. Despite a slight increase in sales in the range between 20,000 and 25,000 (which is probably the result of fewer occurrences of these distances in the data), sales maintain the same average pattern across all distance ranges.

The probable justification for this fact is that competition between short distance stores leads to a greater allocation of resources to attract customers, that is: a competition that improves the market. However, this is a hypothesis that must be confirmed in future analysis.


### Stores with more consecutive promotions should sell more. - FALSE

Consecutive promotions seem to be really impactful to increase sales, the greater the amount of promotions a store has in time, the greater its sales should be, correct? But the analysis of the graph leads us to another interpretation:

!['image'](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73614098/110251714-33552600-7f58-11eb-8330-1a30007408c7.png)

The interpretation of the graph is clear: According to the data provided to us, stores with extended promotions, on average, sell less than stores with traditional promotions every week of the year. The sales pattern is the same for every week, and both promotions follow the trends, however the extended promotion is always with a lower average than the traditional one.

To understand the reason for this, the project must be extended to an analysis of the cause of this fact.


### Stores should sell more after the 10th of each month. - FALSE

When creating hypotheses, it was thought about the possibility of stores selling more after the 10th, as it is the moment that most people receive their share of the monthly income and can spend on products. However, this was not the trend:

!['image'](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73614098/110556686-698bd480-8115-11eb-8c8b-bf5424d67efe.png)

As can be seen in the graphs, there is a clear downward trend in the average sales after the 10th day. However, at the end of the month it is possible to see a recovery in these sales. However, as a final analysis, it is possible to abstract this trend of higher sales volume in the first days of the month.

## 4.0 Machine Learning Model Applied

O problema de previs√£o de vendas na granularidade recebida √© de regress√£o, foram usados alguns pacotes especializados nesse tipo de problema: *Random Forest Regressor*, *Linear Regression*, *XGBoost Regressor*, al√©m de um modelo base utilizando a m√©dia de vendas.

Al√©m disso, as m√©tricas utilizadas para medir a performance foram o *MAE - Mean Average Error*, *MAPE - Mean Avareage Percentage Error*, *RMSE - Root Mean Squared Error*:
